6.0,"Stree 2 was about 45 minutes too long. Stree 2 was funny in the first half of the movie. It had great call backs to the OG Stree. The actors did a really good job reviving their characters. One of the newer characters played by a famous actor felt out of place because it made the film less grounded. The characters from other films that were on the movie felt shoehorned in and not in any way organic and faithful to the world building of the film. The effects of Sarkata were pretty well done.

Compared to first Stree as an allegory, Stree 2 pales in comparison.

The climax was too drawn out and did not follow the rules of the works that it had established.","Stree 2 was about 45 minutes too long. Stree 2 was funny in the first half of the movie.

6.0,"Stree 2 is an above average horror comedy film, which will entertain you well. Don't expect too much from this movie as it will make you laugh out loud or scare you more than Stree. The plus point of Stree 2 is the story that keeps the audience engaged till the end. The makers of the film have presented the story well to the audience.

Talking about Rajkumar Rao, like Stree, he has done an amazing job in the film Stree 2 also. Today, there is hardly any other actor ahead of him in DIALOGUE DELIVERY with excellent expression. Shraddha Kapoor will be seen in an important role in this film. Pankaj Tripathi has played his character well. Similarly, Abhishek Banerjee has also continued his BHEDIYA acting. If we talk about Aparshakti Khurana's acting, you will clearly see the flavor of OVERDOSE in it.

Apart from all this, CAMEO has been used in the right way and at the right place in the film. Especially AKSHAY KUMAR has increased the excitement of the audience by entering this horror comedy universe. Apart from this, you will like the music of the film very much. But the romantic song of Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor appears forced. Finally, one more thing is that the makers of the film failed to display the post credit scene of Stree 2 properly.","Stree 2 is an above average horror comedy film, which will entertain you well.

7.0,"The movie is quite impressive, with excellent conceptualization and reveals. The special cameos and everything combined create both an expected and unexpected perspective that we've all been anticipating from this franchise-or you might say, from this cinematic universe. However, the one thing that disappoints is the ending. It feels clumsy, as if everything was just pieced together without any real thought. It's almost as if the editor was simply told to stitch the clips together, resulting in a lack of smoothness towards the end. The music cuts abruptly, then suddenly resumes, making it feel like the movie ended, and someone just grabbed a random song from YouTube, pasted it, inserted a scene, and then added another YouTube song. It's clear that there were some editing issues towards the end.

Additionally, all the heavy comedy moments were already revealed in the trailer, leaving nothing new or surprising in terms of humor.","The movie is quite impressive, with excellent conceptualization and reveals.

,"Useless jokes, music romance all ruined the movie. In the serious moment comedy is added which is not compulsory. Giving it 1 ⭐. Every jokes is just bla bla. One of the most glaring issues with Stree 2 is its over-reliance on comedy that simply doesn't land. Where the first film skillfully blended horror with humor, this sequel seems to think that more jokes automatically equal more laughs. The result is a barrage of unnecessary gags that feel out of place and forced. Instead of enhancing the narrative, the comedy detracts from it, making the film feel more like a disjointed sketch show than a cohesive story. The humor, which once felt organic and cleverly woven into the plot, now feels like a desperate attempt to recreate the magic of the original.","Useless jokes, music romance all ruined the movie.

9.0,"Acting - What stands out in this movie is the acting of the entire cast, supporting roles and cameo appearances. (10/10)

Story - Story is quite skewed. First half is quite funny and second half is little bland in comparison. (8/10)

Direction - Good job here. (9/10)

Editing - Few instances I felt could have been better but anyway most of the time it is coherent. (8/10)

Comedy- The USP of the film. The comic timing of the cost members is amazing. You will laugh a lot and quite a lot of pop culture references. (10/10)

Horror - There are quite a few jump scare moments in the movie and retains the horror factor that stree 1 had cultivated. (8/10)

8.0,"It was a good mass entertainer. It doesnt get boring for even a second.

Firstly, the part 1 team is back. They have done excellent job same as part 1. Rao and shraddha looked too good together , their scene and chemistry worked like charm. Tripathi ji , khurana, and banerjee all were great.

Storywise movie is weaker than stree 1, but here the execution and editing is very good. Story progresses at good pace, keeps audience engaged, and never lets you rest.

There are 2 cameos and they are good. I liked the ending, it was done in perfect manner, storyline from part 1 was nicely connected.

This is a good entertainer , ill say it is less horror than part 1 but it is full pf good entertainment which is lacking in big budget movies. Watch it asap.","It was a good mass entertainer. It doesnt get boring for even a second.

7.0,"Stree 2 is a decent sequel which does a good job of stitching the Maddock Supernatural Universe together and carve out the path for Vampires of Vijay Nagar, Bhediya 2 and Stree 3 over the next 2 years. The movie has its moments......some really funny but a few that dont land well and some pretty effective jump scares. The actors are as likable as they were in the first movie and the story flows well from the first part through the 2nd to the next one. Overall it is a good watch....but not as good as the first part.

The performances are good especially Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Banerjee. Decent VFX and action. Some scenes and dialogs are really funny especially when delivered by these three. The cameos are pretty good. Akshay is weird, quirky and funny in his scene but didnt feel very menacing in the post credit sequence. Varun's character is well integrated in the movie and has a good entry scene but could have been utilized more effectively. His character lacks the punch and power of his first movie.

The run time of the movie is a bit long at 149 mins and would have benefited from a leaner and crisper production. The movie doesn't get boring but a tighter second half would have definitely lifted it up to the next level. If you liked Stree then you will enjoy Stree 2. However if Stree was not to your liking then Stree 2 is definitely not your cup of tea. It is a fun watch 7/10.","Stree 2 is a decent sequel which does a good job of stitching the Maddock Supernatural Universe together and carve out the path for Vampires of Vijay Nagar, Bhediya 2 and Stree 3 over the next 2 years.

Songs are less but beautiful .

I think every movie lover should watch this movie best one..","This movie is a blend of horror and comedy..the scarier parts feel real and you will jump out of the seat and funny timing is perfect

6.0,What stree 1st part had was that desi essence. It really came well with horror comedy genre and gave a superb movie experience. Sequel is way complex and had unnecessary masala things which harmed the franchise. With the reviews and BO collection my expectations were very high but when i got the chance to watch it I was like omg what the hell is this? This is the worest movie of the maddock horror comedy universe and i really mean it. Still i give this 6 stars because it is way better than the movies which made by bollywood nowadays. But with the brand name of Stree this is a just a typical ordinary movie..,What stree 1st part had was that desi essence.

1.0,"Stree 2 turned out to be as bad as I had feared. Gone is the grounded story telling and performance of Stree1, every actor is over acting to the hilt. They simply copied the template from Part 1 and made part 2 even repeating the jokes and scenes from Part 1. Movie doesn't offer anything new and is painfully predictable. I appreciate that they made Sarkata look scary but everything else was just meh and way too long. The movie could have been easily trimmed by an hour and the actors sadly look really old to play the character they are playing. You don't have to build a cinematic universe just because you can, you have to earn that. They probably would have made a better film had they not increased the budget of the movie. Disappointed!","Stree 2 turned out to be as bad as I had feared. Gone is the grounded story telling and performance of Stree1, every actor is over acting to the hilt.

Perfect mix of comedy, horror, story, cameos, romance & a subtle message to the society.

Story continues after Stree 1 post credit scene. The best part is that the maker have made a new movie but they didn't tamper with a simplicity & authenticity which was loved in Stree1.

All actors have done a fantastic job. Rajkumar Rao, Abhishek Banerjee, Pankaj Tripathi. But the way director Amar Kaushik has used Shraddha is amazing. She carries a superstar aura & lights up the screen each time.

Overall a MUST WATCH.

7.0,"Amazing punches, though few were adapted from old series or movies and re-written in Own style.

Grasping and hilarious 1st half and second half until climax. Climax was like a 80's bollywood movie with very very cliche CGI and VFX effects. In this era of amazing tech where we have RAOne, Kalki 2098 and so on such CGI is not good at all.

Ending could have been better.

Acting of each and every casted member is to its perfection and hilarious, punch timings, reactions and OmG the combination of Rajkumarr Rao and Pankaj Tripathi tickle your ribs.

Shraddha is in her own cuteness too good looking and at point.

Main credit goes to Supporting cast of Jana and Bittu (Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banarjee)

Cameo of Varun dhawan is nicely used.

Over and on top, fun film to watch 1 time in theatres. Get ready to get your funny bones touched multiple times.","Amazing punches, though few were adapted from old series or movies and re-written in Own style.

,Why was she even there. It was so fun so reminiscent of those 1990s days of superstition and excitement. The four guys were so funny their banter super hilarious. Then she comes in like actually comes in and the momentum just dropped entirely to a halt. Now its all about her. It felt like she sucked the breath from the room and in actuality she sucked the fun the laughter from the theater. The entire theatre felt quiet after she arrived in the mid of the movie. Some people walked off the theater after 15 minutes of her coming and rescuing the guys. I don't blame them.

You won't get bored for even a second in the entire movie due to it being full of comedy with perfect punch timing of the actors. It is a good blend of less horror and more comedy!

One important and small spoiler - You would really be amazed to see a couple of cameos in the movie which are incorporated very amazingly and that really makes sense to see.

All the above comments would have been minimal without the background music and the power packed songs of the movie. So, kudos to the music team as well !

It would be injustice to judge the acting skills of actors like Pankaj Tripathi, Shraddha Kapoor, Rajkumar Rao and all other cast of Street 2. They are fabulous as usual.

What was supposed to be a horror movie ended up being a horrible experience instead. The plot was weak, the scares were nonexistent, and the entire execution left much to be desired.

To make matters worse, the movie was filled with senseless, double-meaning dialogues that added no value to the story. And seriously, what was that item song? When will Indian cinema move beyond such outdated and pointless tropes? ""Stree 2"" was a major disappointment.","Since I had enjoyed the first part.

6.0,"Tone, Script & Story: Stree 2 is sequel to movie Stree which also includes other horror comedy movies from Maddock films. This time horror entity named Sarkata returns. It takes away women who put up with modern lifestyle. Will Vicky, Rudra and team able to help them?

Like in part one there lies a condition of innocent lover to deal with villain. In this part to its same, however I feel it's not Vicky so easily as the characters played by Akshay Kumar, Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee and Aparshakti Khurana are also good contenders. Don't worry the role is reserved with Vicky (Rajkummar Rao). It however reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean movie where Calypso is freed by innocent lover. Could it be anybody other than Vicky?

What I liked: The hilarious comedy scenes where even the villan Sarkata was not spared were tremendous.

What I dislike: The story is not strong. It's part of horror comedy universe from Maddock films which include Munjya and Bhediya. I dislike linked movies.

1.0,"I just don't understand the hype about this movie and how this movie is earning so much money. I went to watch this on Friday night and i had returned with a headache. There is nothing much in the movie other than extreme shouting.

The first movie was decent and had a mystery and ended on a note that had a plot to make something good.

This one was utter nonsense and have no plot line. Whatever respect i had about the last movie have diminished after watching this one.

The first half you can sit and bear because of Rajkumar Rao but the second half was not bearable.

The Indian movie industry should spend some money on story writing because i guess an average person can write a better story then this one.","I just don't understand the hype about this movie and how this movie is earning so much money. I went to watch this on Friday night and i had returned with a headache. There is nothing much in the movie other than extreme shouting.

The first movie was decent and had a mystery and ended on a note that had a plot to make something good.

6.0,"Overview: This sequel was a fun continuation of the Stree saga. Particularly the first half was very intriguing and funny. The second half got a bit ridiculous and resembled more of a Marvel multiverse situation.

Plot: The plot centers around a new threat to the town, a headless ghost that is kidnapping young women. The story starts out pretty well with a role reversal to Stree in the first movie. It was a positive start, but they did not hit the same horror notes that the first Stree had. This movie was relying more on jump scares than actual spookiness.

Acting: Strong performances all around. Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee, and Aparkshakti Khuranna form a hilarious quartet. Shraddha Kapoor also puts in a strong acting performance but my gripe would be that she does not get enough screen time.

Music: Songs are good and fun. The soundtrack is enjoyable and fits the movie themes.

Conclusion: I would recommend watching this for some mindless fun, but don't expect too much horror.","Overview: This sequel was a fun continuation of the Stree saga.

10.0,"""Stree 2,"" the much-anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-comedy ""Stree,"" successfully captures the essence of its predecessor while expanding its narrative and character depth. Directed by Amar Kaushik, this film brings back the beloved trio of Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, and Pankaj Tripathi. With a perfect blend of humor, scares, and social commentary, ""Stree 2"" proves to be a worthy successor.

Set in the small town of Chanderi, ""Stree 2"" continues the saga of an enigmatic female spirit who abducts men during a particular festival. The townsfolk, still reeling from the events of the first film, are forced to confront their fears as a new wave of unexplained disappearances occurs. Vicky (Rajkummar Rao) has now taken on the mantle of a local hero, determined to protect the town alongside his quirky friends and the fiercely independent Shraddha (Shraddha Kapoor), who again plays a pivotal role in unraveling the mystery.

The plot thickens as new characters are introduced, including a charismatic ghost hunter and a rival town with its own supernatural troubles. The humor is sharper, the scares are more intense, and the social themes reflect contemporary issues such as feminism, toxic masculinity, and community resilience.

The film's biggest strength lies in its performances. Rajkummar Rao shines as Vicky, delivering a performance that balances comedic timing with emotional depth. Shraddha Kapoor portrays her character with charm and strength, further establishing her as a formidable presence in the story. Pankaj Tripathi, as the eccentric and wise local expert, brings levity and wisdom, while also providing memorable one-liners that delight the audience.

The supporting cast rounds out the film nicely, with memorable performances that add flavor and depth to the narrative. New additions to the cast also impress, bringing fresh dynamics to the story.

The humor in Stree 2 is a mix of slapstick, situational comedy, and witty dialogue. The film doesn't shy away from pushing the boundaries, delivering some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. The supporting cast, especially Abhishek Banerjee, plays a significant role in providing comic relief. The horror elements are handled well, with some genuinely creepy moments that effectively balance the comedy.

Amar Kaushik showcases his knack for creating a perfect blend of horror and comedy once again. The pacing is steady, allowing for both thrilling moments and comedic relief. The cinematography captures the eerie yet vibrant essence of Chanderi, utilizing clever camera angles and striking visuals that enhance both the spooky and comedic elements.

The soundtrack of ""Stree 2"" features catchy tracks that complement the film's tone. The background score effectively amplifies tension during horror sequences while allowing for light-hearted moments. The sound design, complete with eerie whispers and sudden scares, adds to the film's overall impact.

While primarily a horror-comedy, ""Stree 2"" delivers poignant messages about gender roles and societal expectations. The film addresses the importance of confronting one's fears and challenges traditional masculinity, making it not just entertaining but thought-provoking as well.

""Stree 2"" is a commendable sequel that successfully builds on the success of its predecessor. With its engaging story, strong performances, and a delightful mix of horror and humor, it's a cinematic experience that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages.

After Drishyam, a sequel which was made justifiable in Bollywood is Stree 2.

From the trailer we realised that this time its Sarkatte who is gonna make us fear & if in Stree , when the village wants to rid off from Stree , here in Stree 2 , Stree becomes their last resort..

Director Amar Kaushik & writer Niren Bhatt widened the horizon of the horror world.

We could see the innocence of Vicky, foolishness of Jana , the mystery of Shraddha, funniness of Rudra not loosening the essence from its original.

Perfect placement of cameos thereby rising the scope of horror universe, Stree 2 is a movie which the industry was longing since 8 months of this year.

The VFX, the BGM & other technical aspects was top notch.

7.0,"So it was an amazing theatrical experience to witness Stree's Part-2 after a long wait of 6years. And in one word I'm summarizing it :- ''It's a damn perfect sequel"" . Soon we are gonna witness some crazy madness of Horror-Comedy Universe like Avengers series because Maddock Pictures is nailing their interesting characters day by day (apart from Roohi) for it.

So lets discuss about basic storyline of this movie. This movie started from exact scene where Stree part-1 Ended, they also introduced back story in the form of a song by played by Pankaj Tripathy. A new threat named as ' Sarkatta ' came to the village of Chanderi and our funky team is on the mission of rescue. That's it.

The Acting performances of all the characters were brilliant. They justified their chemistry among them like first part And it was a reunion of all 4 Male Characters after that Bhediya's post credit scenes incident.. Some cameos by this Stree Universe played some important roles in this movie whereas the part played by them was quite short and could have been given more importance. The Songs, BGMs and Music were damn good according to the situations. The screenplay was quite gripping and won't let you feel bored for a single minute like the first part. The first half of the movie is specially brilliant with some interesting funny moments where you will laugh out loud for sure, it was really an amazing experience in the theatre after shouting out that loud with the whole audiences. The 2nd half had little bit less funny moments and some seriousness was surely there according to it's story. But the Lover of Stree Universe gonna love it for sure. The Final battle was quite long and based on CGI Effects so yeah that could have been more better but yeah it was adjustable.

Overall a completely Family Friendly Movie (if you ignore those double meaning dialogues). Do watch and Enjoy with whole Family.. It's 7 out of 10 Stars from my side..","So it was an amazing theatrical experience to witness Stree's Part-2 after a long wait of 6years.

1.0,"Stree-1 had a female ghost who was behind men, while Stree-2 have a male ghost kidnapping women. Rest all characters are same.

The plot is not well-thought at all. For the sake of creating horror, a headless demon keeps coming on the screen after every few minutes.

The story flows in a quite obvious way- Evil always loses.

The movie doesn't end immediately after the main demon is destroyed. It runs for another 10-12 minutes to give a glimpse of probably another sequel followed by two 'Item songs' which would make you ask yourself why these songs were added in the first place and why you are watching it.","Stree-1 had a female ghost who was behind men, while Stree-2 have a male ghost kidnapping women.

7.0,"Stree 2 is a delightful sequel that successfully blends horror and comedy, much like its predecessor. Directed by Amar Kaushik, the film retains the quirky charm of the original while introducing a fresh twist.

The story follows Bicky (Rajkummar Rao), Bittu (Aparshakti Khurana), and Jana (Abhishek Banerjee) as they team up with Rudra (Pankaj Tripathi) and Shraddha Kapoor's mysterious character to defeat this new menace.

The film revisits the eerie town of Chanderi, where the ghostly legend of Stree continues to cast a shadow.

Thank God I have not spent money for gold class tickets. Even comedy also not good, they have not shown proper story of sarkatta, Simply Bhediya entry. I think they have spent money to create hype for this movie. For sure it will earn 800-1000 crore but not worth even 100 crore. They tried to copy from Hollywood like 2 post credits n all. Looks like paid youtubers to create popularity and curiosity which making them run to theatre. God knows when our movie class will be extremely good in reality. By the way I am a big fan of STREE which released in 2018 but this one is not a good sequel disappointed me. They could have made it way too good, look like they don't even bother to put efforts to make a good movie as if they are very much sure of success of this movie. This is kind of cheating with the fans, I may never watch another movie of this universe in theatre for sure as I got to know they are just selling the brand with some tricks in market and very lazy to put efforts to make good movie with good story.","It is a copy paste movie with no creativity.

There are very few hindi movies which maintain their reputation with sequels and this is definitely one of them. Really loved it. Dialogue delivery and comic timing is excellent. Every character are hilarious with their acting. Raj kumar Rao is one of the finest actors and he didn't disappoint at all. Writing is also very good. After a long time enjoyed a bollywood movie. Content is excellent. Also you will love the little cameos. This is now becoming an excellent universe of Dinesh Vijan with Stree, Bhediya and Munjiya.","Enjoyed every bit of it.

7.0,"The moment I saw the first part on TV, I regretted not watching it on big screen as it was a perfect blend of comedy and horror, but alas, nothing could be done except...waiting for part 2!

When I got to know that Stree 2 was hitting theaters, I was very excited and knew that I wouldn't miss it, so I went on the first day itself.

But as Bollywood have a record of destroying sequels, I was worried that by watching this, I don't lose interest in this genre and the Stree universe. But I was wrong.

Stree 2 felt like it was literally the continuation of part 1, like nothing changed, or, I may say, it got elevated, the tone, the humour, and the hilarious one-liners remained as fun as it were earlier, the horror part felt more spooky; and there were few jump scares, which I personally enjoyed. Songs were not so enjoyable but it won't hinder the experience.

The post-credit scene(s) made sure we looked forward for the next bomb.

The acting needs no review, Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, and the gang were perfect, along with some exciting cameos thrown multiple times, which increased the excitement for upcoming projects.

Shraddha Kapoor's screen time felt a little less but I believe the character was portrayed as a mystery so it may be the reason for it, but though for less time, her presence adds a lot of charm (and action too!).

Go watch to get a good and needed change from the common recent Bollywood masses.","The moment I saw the first part on TV, I regretted not watching it on big screen as it was a perfect blend of comedy and horror, but alas, nothing could be done except...waiting for part 2!

I mean my mother, who enjoys comedy was bored the whole time (you can leave me aside because my expectations have gone up because of Hollywood and Anime scripts). But seriously, if you bore some hardcore Bollywood fans, you must have really messed it up.

1.0,"""Stree 2"" is a colossal disappointment and a glaring example of how not to make a sequel. What was supposed to be a continuation of a beloved story instead feels like a lazy cash grab, devoid of any creativity or effort.

The plot is an absolute mess, as if the writers threw together random ideas without any coherence or care. There's no suspense, no horror, and the comedy is so forced that it's more cringe-inducing than funny. The film utterly fails to recapture the magic of the original, making the entire experience frustrating to watch.

The characters, who once had depth and charm, are reduced to hollow shells. It's painful to see talented actors wasting their skills on such poorly written roles. The new characters are forgettable at best and irritating at worst, adding nothing but noise to an already chaotic script.

Pacing? Nonexistent. The movie drags on endlessly, testing the audience's patience with every passing minute. By the time it limps to its uninspired conclusion, you'll be relieved that it's finally over. The so-called ""climax"" is laughably bad and utterly devoid of any tension or payoff.

""Stree 2"" is a shameless attempt to capitalize on the success of its predecessor without putting in any of the work that made the first film a success. It's a slap in the face to fans who expected even a fraction of the quality of the original. If you value your time and your memory of ""Stree,"" do yourself a favor and skip this disastrous sequel.","""Stree 2"" is a colossal disappointment and a glaring example of how not to make a sequel.

6.0,"This is a good movie in the horror-comedy space. It's previous installment was much subtle and more nuanced in terms of message delivery. However, Stree 2 seems to go over the top in showing horror. It goes all out in showing jumpscares and VFX-generated ghost scenes.

The most surprising is that after a point, the audience in the theatre stops giving a damn about the jumpscares and starts ignoring them. There is a famous saying that do not make a person so scared that they lose the ability to be frightened. This film falls short of its expectations in terms of the storyline; however, I would like to appreciate the special effects used in this film. Will I watch it again? Hell no!

9.0,"Stree 2 successfully dodges the common pitfalls of sequels, delivering a thoroughly entertaining experience that feels both fresh and familiar. While the storyline mirrors the original, it doesn't come across as stale. The first half is packed with wit and humor, offering plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. Though the second half loses a bit of that momentum, it still manages to keep the audience engaged.

One of the standout aspects of Stree 2 is how Maddock Films continues to expand its horror-comedy universe. The integration of different elements within this universe is seamless and clever, making the cameos both entertaining and meaningful without feeling forced.

The performances are a highlight, with Rajkummar Rao and Abhishek Banerjee stealing the show. Rajkummar's endearing, lovestruck expressions add a layer of charm to his character, making his infatuation with Shraddha Kapoor's character both amusing and believable. Abhishek Banerjee continues his excellent work from the first film, bringing his unique brand of madness to the screen. While Aparshakti Khurana has a smaller role, he delivers a decent performance, and Pankaj Tripathi is, as always, a delight with his wisecracks and endearing affection for Shama. Shraddha Kapoor, though given limited dialogue, impresses with her action sequences and expressive acting. Her ""mass entry"" is definitely something to watch out for. Tamannah Bhatia's cameo, complete with a dance number, adds to the film's charm.

On the downside, the horror elements are a bit underwhelming. If you're expecting spine-chilling scares, you might be disappointed. The film creates tension with the introduction of 'Sar-kata', but it doesn't deliver enough jump scares to satisfy horror enthusiasts. Stree 2 leans more towards comedy with a folklore backdrop, and while it won't make your skin crawl, it will certainly make you laugh-a goal it achieves exceptionally well.

Overall, Stree 2 avoids the trap many Hindi film sequels fall into, where the reunion of cast and crew feels like a cash grab. This film is genuinely entertaining, fun, and leaves us eagerly anticipating the next chapter in Maddock Films' expanding horror-comedy universe.","Stree 2 successfully dodges the common pitfalls of sequels, delivering a thoroughly entertaining experience that feels both fresh and familiar.

8.0,"After a long wait of nearly six years, Stree 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-comedy Stree, has finally arrived in theaters, and it does not disappoint. The makers have successfully recaptured the magic of the original, blending humor and horror in the perfect ratio to deliver a thrilling and highly entertaining film. With its stellar performances, engaging story, and top-notch technical execution, the film sets a high standard for future installments in what promises to be an exciting cinematic franchise.

Niren Bhatt's story is the backbone of Stree 2, and he skillfully takes the tale of Stree forward. The narrative is well-constructed, filled with ample doses of comedy and unexpected twists that keep the audience hooked. Niren Bhatt's tight screenplay is one of the film's highlights, a clever blend of witty dialogues, humorous punchlines, and engaging character interactions. Amar Kaushik returns to direct the sequel and his direction is sharper & more confident this time. He skillfully blends elements of horror and comedy, a genre mix that's notoriously tricky to pull off. Kaushik ensures that the horror sequences have genuine chills, while the comedic moments land perfectly, often in the same breath.

Stree 2 runs for 149 minutes, and every second is packed with entertainment. Once again, the musical duo Sachin-Jigar has delivered chartbuster tracks. The songs are catchy. Justin Varghese's background score is apt for the genre, enhancing the suspenseful and spooky atmosphere. On the technical front, Digital Domain's VFX work is world-class, making the supernatural elements feel convincing and impactful. Hemanti Sarkar's editing ensures the film remains crisp, with no dull moments dragging the pace.

Rajkummar Rao reprises his role and the performance is once again the heart of the film, making his character both endearing and hilarious. Shraddha Kapoor with her effortless charm, seamlessly blends mystery with a hint of mischief. Pankaj Tripathi is a scene-stealer with his impeccable comic timing and witty one-liners. Aparshakti Khurana shines, especially in the first half, bringing his unique style of humor to the table. Abhishek Banerjee continues to excel in his role. The cameos by Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan are delightful surprises that hint at an exciting future for this developing ""monsterverse.""

For those eagerly waiting, be sure to stay until the end-there's not only a post-credits teaser but also two songs before the final credits roll. The monsterverse is just getting started, and if this sequel is any indication, we're in for a thrilling ride ahead.

Stree 2 runs for 149 minutes, and every second is packed with entertainment. Once again, the musical duo Sachin-Jigar has delivered chartbuster tracks. The songs are catchy. Justin Varghese's background score is apt for the genre, enhancing the suspenseful and spooky atmosphere. On the technical front, Digital Domain's VFX work is world-class, making the supernatural elements feel convincing and impactful. Hemanti Sarkar's editing ensures the film remains crisp, with no dull moments dragging the pace.

Rajkummar Rao reprises his role and the performance is once again the heart of the film, making his character both endearing and hilarious. Shraddha Kapoor with her effortless charm, seamlessly blends mystery with a hint of mischief. Pankaj Tripathi is a scene-stealer with his impeccable comic timing and witty one-liners. Aparshakti Khurana shines, especially in the first half, bringing his unique style of humor to the table. Abhishek Banerjee continues to excel in his role. The cameos by Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan are delightful surprises that hint at an exciting future for this developing ""monsterverse.""

For those eagerly waiting, be sure to stay until the end-there's not only a post-credits teaser but also two songs before the final credits roll. The monsterverse is just getting started, and if this sequel is any indication, we're in for a thrilling ride ahead.

8.0,"After all plots are exhausted and there is nothing new in formula based movie domain, there comes a refreshing take on family entertainment.

Now this is a horror movie that is thoroughly entertaining and you can take your kids to watch.

Technically there might be flaws, but it sure is a great entertainer which to me, it's a job done well.

Actors are convincing, Pankaj Tripathi is great as ever. Rajkumar is a great actor and has done great justice to his role. Shraddha Kapoor has a great presence and the story is convincing. Though I personally believe that creating a ghost who also is an MCP was unnecessary, kind of forced feminist angle in the story line, and to reach to the very last scene, one has to go through two full item songs and credits. (Probably an easter egg for the patient viewers)","After all plots are exhausted and there is nothing new in formula based movie domain, there comes a refreshing take on family entertainment.

6.0,"The premise is set where the first film ended, and with a great over-arching story and slipping in gender bias in culture and society in the mix. The idea is strong, on how Stree became, what caused her to be and how Chanderi is affected because of Stree's absence. The film gets going and arrives at the new situation pretty fast without wasting any frames, but losses steams 45-50 mins later and becomes a sore to sit through, listen and watch pretty easily.

An intriguing and comical plot ensues, a stretched shout-fest. With screeching sound from actor rather than letting actors work on the grounded and subtle fashion. Saving and enjoyable grace is the desi-pop references sprinkled all over the dialogues.

Also, a big miss is the word building, Chanderi is a character in its own way, and they completely removed it from the film. Instead of letting the town, its building and streets breathe and fill the frames in the background, the town is reduced to key inescapable moments and a reminder in few dialogues.","The premise is set where the first film ended, and with a great over-arching story and slipping in gender bias in culture and society in the mix.

They can show a greater villain than that but the only thing they needed is to make movie which can be fitted in their universe so they can make more & more money. If you now watch stree 1 eventually it will make you feel afraid that's what I expected in stree 2 also but they couldn't handled it.

8.0,"I just watched Stree 2 and I'm blown away by how much it improves on the first movie! Rajkummar Rao is ABSOLUTE PERFECTION as Vicky, bringing a level of depth, nuance, and charm that's unparalleled. His banter with his friends throughout the movie is some of the film's funniest moments - the camaraderie and chemistry between them is so natural and authentic, it's like you're right there with them, laughing and joking along.

And let's not forget the incredible Pankaj Tripathi , bringing his signature wit and eccentricity to the film. The supporting cast, including Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banerjee, deliver standout performances that add to the film's humor and charm. But let's be real, Rao and Tripathi are the real MVPs here - their performances are a masterclass in comedic timing, dramatic range, and sheer screen presence.shraddha kapoor is in the movie briefly not as much as the other cast, she's fine but it's the other cast who mostly do the heavy lifting.

The horror elements are ramped up, with some seriously creepy moments that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. The comedy is still there, but it's more refined and doesn't feel forced.

What really impressed me was how the movie built on the story and universe of the first film, and even expands on the connections to the Bhediya universe. It's clear the filmmakers are creating a larger, more intricate world that's just begging to be explored.

The pacing is tighter, the scares are scarier, and the laughs are louder. It's a masterclass in balancing tone and genre.

The climax is intense and satisfying, and the ending sets up some serious potential for the next movie.

Overall, Stree 2 is a must-watch for fans of the first movie, Bhediya, and horror-comedy in general. Rao and Tripathi's performances alone are worth the price of admission - they're geniuses, and this film is a testament to their talent.","I just watched Stree 2 and I'm blown away by how much it improves on the first movie!

4.0,"While Stree 2 boasts impressive cinematography, it unfortunately falls short in key areas. The horror element, which should have been central, feels more like an afterthought, failing to evoke any real sense of fear or tension. I understand that the movie leans heavily on the horror-comedy genre, but sadly, even the comedic aspects didn't hit the mark. The humor felt mundane and forced, lacking the originality or wit needed to stand out.

Most of the cast delivered solid performances, but there were notable letdowns from Shraddha and Pankaj, particularly in scenes where their impact should have been stronger. The integration of Bhediya and Akshay Kumar seemed more like a forced attempt at crossover appeal rather than a seamless addition to the story. While there were a few punchlines that worked, they weren't enough to justify sitting through the full 2.5-hour runtime.

Overall, despite some positive aspects, Stree 2 is a below-average film, and it doesn't live up to the potential of its predecessor.","While Stree 2 boasts impressive cinematography, it unfortunately falls short in key areas.

7.0,"Stree 2 continues the horror-comedy saga, following the events of the first film. This time, a new villain, Sarkata, emerges, targeting women who embrace modern lifestyles. Vicky (Rajkummar Rao), along with his quirky team, including Akshay Kumar, Pankaj Tripathi, and Aparshakti Khurana, must once again confront the supernatural. While the story echoes the first film, the sequel delivers a rollercoaster of laughs, thrilling moments, and memorable performances, particularly from Rao and Tripathi. The chemistry between the cast adds depth to the film, keeping the audience entertained.

While Stree 2 excels in humor and action, some elements, like the CGI-heavy final battle, fall short of expectations. The film also suffers from a slightly dragged-out climax and a storyline that lacks the surprises of its predecessor. The integration of characters from the larger Maddock horror-comedy universe (including Bhediya) adds flavor but may feel confusing for those unfamiliar with the earlier films. Despite these drawbacks, the movie is a fun watch for fans of the genre, with standout moments that will leave you laughing long after the credits roll.

The film's pacing is solid in the first half, filled with comedy and tension, but slows down a bit in the second. Akshay Kumar's cameo adds excitement, though some characters could have had more screen time. While the adult humor may not be suitable for all audiences, it balances well with the film's eerie, yet comedic, premise. The soundtrack and background score elevate the experience, making Stree 2 a fitting, if slightly imperfect, sequel that maintains the charm of the original while expanding the horror-comedy universe.

Overall, Stree 2 is a thrilling, hilarious continuation of the Stree franchise, delivering a satisfying blend of horror, humor, and heart. While it doesn't surpass the first film in every aspect, it's a worthy follow-up that fans of the genre-and the Stree universe-will enjoy.","Stree 2 continues the horror-comedy saga, following the events of the first film.

The film's pacing is solid in the first half, filled with comedy and tension, but slows down a bit in the second. Akshay Kumar's cameo adds excitement, though some characters could have had more screen time. While the adult humor may not be suitable for all audiences, it balances well with the film's eerie, yet comedic, premise. The soundtrack and background score elevate the experience, making Stree 2 a fitting, if slightly imperfect, sequel that maintains the charm of the original while expanding the horror-comedy universe.

Overall, Stree 2 is a thrilling, hilarious continuation of the Stree franchise, delivering a satisfying blend of horror, humor, and heart. While it doesn't surpass the first film in every aspect, it's a worthy follow-up that fans of the genre-and the Stree universe-will enjoy.",1
4.0,"With Stree out of the picture, a new headless monster is out on the prowl. The victims are girls with modern thinking and the monster's agenda is to glorify patriarchy while establishing oppression on women. Once again, Vicky the saviour is approached to save the town and he is again waiting for his love. As the group gather to find out the truth about the headless monster and how to defeat him, it demands for a team up within the universe. How do they defeat the monster and will the truth about the mystery girl be revealed, forms rest of the story.

Amar Kaushik's direction tries to follow the prequel and the camaraderie between the four men. The humor is in abundance with only few working and much of it is in the first half itself. The fun is genuine and the established characters make it all the more easy in pushing the story forward. The first half does end on a decent note with commendable balance between horror and humor. The director succeed in building up the story till the half but it is the second half that falters. The writing gets weak and the story barely moves in the second half, relying heavily on the special appearances.

I found exactly one joke funny in the second half and though the actors try their best, the script doesn't offer them much. The surprise special appearance starts off good but the whole gag was made good by the two actors with their comic timing and not due to the writing. The dragged final act did show signs on getting revived but the final reveal is rather underwhelmingly presented. The overuse of VFX in the final act undermined the big reveal's impact. It didn't make sense to have two songs in the end credits, especially the second one but Shraddha Kapoor looked best in her red saree and the IMAX guy ruined it by turning the lights on.

6.0,"Stree 2 continues the legacy of its predecessor, offering a blend of horror and comedy, but with some noticeable shifts in tone and focus. While the first half of the film provides plenty of laughs and a few spine-chilling moments, the second half leans more heavily into resolving the supernatural problems faced by the villagers of Chanderi, which leads to a somewhat predictable horror scenario.

The film sees the return of familiar faces, including Rajkumar Rao, Aparshakti Khurana, and Pankaj Tripathi, who continue to impress with their performances. However, Shraddha Kapoor's appearance is quite late in the film, and the mystery surrounding her character, which had intrigued fans since the first movie, is finally addressed. Though this adds an element of intrigue, the film's balance between horror and comedy feels off compared to the first Stree. The comedy is less frequent, and the horror moments, while unsettling, seem overshadowed by the frequent, often unnecessary appearances of the ghost.

The introduction of new characters, like Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan, somewhat shifts the focus away from the original cast, making it feel like the movie is preparing for a larger universe, potentially with future installments. While this idea is intriguing, it also detracts from the charm of the first film, where the ensemble cast was the highlight. The inclusion of these new characters, particularly in cameos, feels forced and lacks impact, especially Akshay Kumar's role, which doesn't seem to serve the narrative in any meaningful way.

In terms of positives, the villain, Sarkata, is a standout with impressive use of VFX, which adds a chilling and visually captivating element to the movie. Rajkumar Rao continues to shine, effortlessly carrying his role, while Shraddha Kapoor's performance fits well into the storyline, adding depth to her character. The film smartly touches on themes of male-dominated society and its impact, blending social commentary with supernatural elements.

However, Stree 2 suffers from a weaker story and fails to capitalize on the potential of its villain, who could have been used to create a more compelling and eerie narrative. The local flavor that made the first film so distinct is missing here, which diminishes the charm of the setting and its cultural relevance. The supporting cast, while talented, doesn't receive as much focus, leaving the film feeling less cohesive than its predecessor.

Overall, Stree 2 is a good movie, but it falls short of the magic that made the first film a unique blend of horror, comedy, and drama. The film's attempt to expand its universe might appeal to some, but for fans expecting the same level of enjoyment and scares as Stree 1, this sequel may feel like a missed opportunity.","Stree 2 continues the legacy of its predecessor, offering a blend of horror and comedy, but with some noticeable shifts in tone and focus.

1.0,"It is indigestible mixture of mix of Ajooba, Bhedia, Stree 1 & many more, Indian viewers should up their level to rate this type of worst movies.

In its first half, Stree 2 has the texture and whimsy of Raj & DK's original screenplay (Niren Bhatt has penned the sequel). The wordplay is consistently funny - ""Intimate feasting,"" Bittu smiles at his beloved, though he means intermittent fasting - and there are a series of callbacks that will delight fans of the first. A lot of time is expended in plot establishment and the assembly of the core team. ""First Stree, then Bhediya... why do I always get stuck?"" complains Jana (Abhishek Banerjee), back from a detour to Delhi.

The commentary on patriarchy and gender dynamics that lent a purposeful edge to Kaushik's debut film is kept to a minimum here. Sarkata expressly attacks women with adhunik soch (modern thinking), which spans smoking, drinking, and marrying outside one's caste. Strangely, Rudra's suggestion to lure him out involves hosting a dance program, hardly a modern invention. Equally bizarre is a sequence where the surviving womenfolk of Chanderi unanimously elect Vicky as their savior (this was handled better in Stree, through a personal backstory).","It is indigestible mixture of mix of Ajooba, Bhedia, Stree 1 & many more, Indian viewers should up their level to rate this type of worst movies.

Mr Tripathi is always a joyous actor to watch.

I must end by saying that the addition of Akshay, Varun and creating a whole other universe is a big edition today for new movie franchises coming forward.","Rajkumar Rao is the perfect vaccum filler after Irrfan.

6.0,"The 2024 release of Stree 2 marked the return to the eerie yet endearing town of Chanderi, where folklore and reality intertwine. Directed by Amar Kaushik, this sequel attempts to recapture the magic of its predecessor while introducing new supernatural elements. However, while it hits some high notes, particularly with its music and portrayal of rural India, it struggles to maintain the same gripping narrative that made the original a standout.

Direction and Storytelling

Amar Kaushik's direction shines in moments where the film balances horror and comedy-a signature of the original Stree. The sequel introduces a new antagonist, Sarkata, a headless entity targeting women who embrace modernity. This gender-reversal plotline offers a fresh perspective, flipping the script from men being the victims to women. However, despite this intriguing premise, the screenplay lacks the tightness and coherence of the first installment. The narrative meanders, especially in the second half, leading to a loss of engagement. The inclusion of certain sequences, such as the abrupt special appearances by Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan, feels more like a setup for a broader cinematic universe than a necessity for the plot, disrupting the film's overall flow.

Performances

Rajkummar Rao reprises his role as Vicky with the same earnestness, bringing depth to his character's evolution from a naive tailor to a man confronting otherworldly challenges. His comedic timing remains impeccable, providing some of the film's most genuine laughs. Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banerjee, as Bittu and Jana respectively, continue to deliver strong supporting performances, their camaraderie adding warmth to the narrative. Pankaj Tripathi's portrayal of Rudra is a highlight; his delivery of shuddh Hindi one-liners adds a unique flavor to the film's humor. However, Shraddha Kapoor's character feels underutilized. Her sporadic appearances add mystery but lack substantial contribution to the storyline, leaving her potential largely untapped.

Music and Sound Design

The film's soundtrack emerges as its strongest asset. The songs are not only melodious but also seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhancing the storytelling experience. The background score adeptly shifts between eerie and playful, complementing the film's tonal changes. The sound design deserves special mention, particularly in scenes involving Sarkata. The auditory cues associated with the headless monster amplify the tension, making his appearances more impactful.

Visual Effects and Cinematography

Visually, Stree 2 is a mixed bag. The depiction of Sarkata is commendable; the special effects team has crafted a convincing and terrifying entity. The scenes where his head detaches and moves independently are both chilling and fascinating. In contrast, the portrayal of Bhediya feels subpar, with visual effects that appear rushed and unpolished, detracting from the immersion. The cinematography, however, captures the essence of rural India beautifully. The locales are vibrant and authentic, showcasing the rustic charm of Chanderi and its surroundings. These visuals not only provide a picturesque backdrop but also ground the supernatural elements in a relatable setting.

Editing and Pacing

One of the film's notable shortcomings is its editing. Unlike the first installment, where the editing was crisp and contributed to a taut narrative, Stree 2 suffers from a lack of cohesion. Several scenes feel prolonged without adding significant value, leading to a sluggish pace, especially in the latter half. This uneven pacing affects the buildup of suspense and dilutes the overall impact of the climax.

Action Sequences

The action choreography in Stree 2 is serviceable but lacks innovation. The confrontations with Sarkata are predictable and fail to evoke the intended thrill. Given the film's horror-comedy genre, there's an expectation for creative and unexpected action sequences that blend scares with laughs-a balance that the film struggles to achieve consistently.

Script and Engagement

The script attempts to weave humor, horror, and social commentary, but it doesn't mesh as effectively as in the original. The dialogues, while humorous in parts, often resort to clichés, and the plot twists are foreseeable. The initial intrigue wanes as the story progresses, leading to a disengaged viewing experience. On a second watch, the film's flaws become more pronounced, and the novelty wears off, making it less enjoyable. However, the music retains its charm, standing out as a consistent positive element.

Overall Impression

Stree 2 offers a blend of horror and comedy set against the backdrop of small-town India, enriched by its music and sound design. However, it falls short of the benchmark set by its predecessor. The average performances, inconsistent visual effects, and a less engaging script make it an average, one-time watch. While it provides entertainment, it lacks the depth and novelty that made the first film a memorable experience.","The 2024 release of Stree 2 marked the return to the eerie yet endearing town of Chanderi, where folklore and reality intertwine.

The second part centers on Sarkata's kidnapping of young, contemporary ladies because he has a grudge against Stree. He shaves their heads and makes them drape a white saree. It is very evident that #Stree2 was created only to capitalize on the success of the first instalment. Some scenes are funny, but many are blatantly asinine. Overall, the movie is a massive let down.

1.0,"The movie seems to have been created without much care for its storyline or structure. There is no coherent plot, and the narrative fails to maintain any rhythm or logic. It appears as though the filmmakers put this together just for the sake of doing so, rather than crafting an engaging story. If you're planning to watch this film, it's best to turn off your brain, as it is more likely to leave you with a headache than deliver laughs or thrills. While there may be one or two songs that are somewhat enjoyable, the performances from the cast fall flat, as every actor seems to have been part of a mindless and poorly directed film. The entire experience feels like a waste of both time and money, and even a standard Hindi-dubbed South Indian film offers much better entertainment in comparison. Ultimately, the movie disappoints on multiple fronts, making it a regrettable watch for most viewers.","The movie seems to have been created without much care for its storyline or structure.

While there may be one or two songs that are somewhat enjoyable, the performances from the cast fall flat, as every actor seems to have been part of a mindless and poorly directed film. The entire experience feels like a waste of both time and money, and even a standard Hindi-dubbed South Indian film offers much better entertainment in comparison. Ultimately, the movie disappoints on multiple fronts, making it a regrettable watch for most viewers.",0
9.0,"""Stree 2,"" the highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-comedy hit, returns to the haunted town of Chanderi with a fresh and terrifying twist. Directed by Amar Kaushik and written by Niren Bhatt, the film follows Vicky (Rajkummar Rao) and his friends as they once again face off against a supernatural threat, this time a headless entity that is mysteriously abducting women.

The film masterfully blends elements of horror, comedy, and suspense, creating a gritty and gripping narrative that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The direction by Amar Kaushik is sharp and precise, ensuring that the story unfolds at a fast pace without losing any of its comedic charm. The cinematography by Jishnu Bhattacharjee captures the eerie atmosphere of Chanderi perfectly, while Hemanti Sarkar's editing ensures a smooth and engaging viewing experience.

Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee, and Aparshakti Khurana all deliver standout performances, breathing life into their characters with a perfect balance of humor and tension. Their chemistry and timing are impeccable, making the film as entertaining as it is thrilling.

The background score by Justin Varghese is appropriately eerie and enhances the suspense, while the songs by Sachin-Jigar fit well within the film's context, even if they aren't particularly memorable outside of it. The film's ability to seamlessly integrate its various elements-story, screenplay, and music-into a cohesive whole is a testament to the talent of everyone involved.

With a budget of 50 crore and a box office collection estimated at 199 crore, ""Stree 2"" has proven to be a commercial success as well, appealing to both horror enthusiasts and fans of the original film. The movie is a must-watch, not just for those who enjoyed the first ""Stree,"" but for anyone looking for a film that combines chills, laughs, and a fast-paced plot.

Rating: 9/10 or 4.5/5 - ""Stree 2"" is a well-crafted sequel that delivers on its promise, offering a perfect mix of horror, comedy, and action. It's a film that engages from start to finish, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre and beyond.","""Stree 2,"" the highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-comedy hit, returns to the haunted town of Chanderi with a fresh and terrifying twist.

It did not disappoint; the comedy scenes were well executed and the references of ither movies worked great.

There are two special appearances, one of Akshay Kumar and another Varun Dhawan. Both were entertaining.

The camaraderie between Pankaj Tripathi, Rao and Khurrana was what I expected to enjoy it was the worth the payment.

Shraddha Kapoor looks just as amazing as always.

Last song Khoobsurat was good to listen.

However, a few scenes were not very interesting to watch and just simply extended the runtime. 2 hours runtime would have been brilliant too.","Among the releases this long weekend in India, I think Stree 2 was most anticipated and welcomed.

**Street 2** is a Bollywood horror-comedy that continues the story from the first movie, ""Stree."" The film brings back the main characters, including Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, and Pankaj Tripathi, who play their roles well, adding humor and drama to the spooky storyline.

The story picks up with the mysterious spirit, Stree, who is still haunting the town. The characters come together to solve the mystery and stop Stree once and for all. There are some funny moments, clever dialogues, and a good mix of scares and laughs.

However, the movie has its flaws. The plot sometimes feels stretched, and some parts might not be as exciting or scary as expected. The first half is engaging, but the second half might lose some of your interest. The climax is decent, but it could have been stronger.

And don't even get me started on the scary parts. The VFX were just plain bad. Instead of being scary, it was more like, ""What is even happening?"" It gave me a headache, honestly.

9.0,"Making a sequel to an already adored and loved movie is a Herculean task, but the makers took on this challenge and came out with flying colors.

Unlike other sequels where each part lacks connection, this one follows up on the first installment. This time, the women of Chanderi village are the prey of Sarkata's attacks, and their messiah Vicky, with the help of his lady love and Stree, of course, is hunting it. Who is Sarkata, how can they defeat it, and what's the relevance? These are the questions to watch out for.

This time, the story is spookier and fits well in the horror genre. There are ample jump scares, making it a must-watch for horror lovers. Meanwhile, the comic sequences have been handled expertly, and you can't stop laughing out loud. The makers have struck the right balance. Niren Bhatt's writing is the masterstroke here, as the dialogues are what ups the game for this movie.

This film truly belongs to Rajkummar Rao. He has proven his acting prowess time and again, and he shines here as well. His antics, from lover boy to delivering one-liners, are well executed. Shraddha Kapoor, though in limited time, shines and has got that innocent face yet menacing presence at the same time-what a killer combination (pun intended). Pankaj Tripathi, this time with a meatier role, nails it. Abhishek Banerjee shines in every scene with his impeccable comic timing. Aparshakti Khurana, however, needs to up his game as he appears repetitive.

Amar Kaushik's direction is spot on, and he has created a world that people are loving. A tight script with the story which is engaging and progresses logically, leaving you eagerly awaiting the third part as soon as the credits roll. The songs, especially 'Aaj Ki Raat' and 'Aayi Nai,' are bangers and surely going to be played in pubs for a long time. A movie like this needed a visual of a ghost that gives you chills, and the team of computer graphics, prosthetics, and VFX has done a fabulous job.

The connection with Bhediya is perfectly amalgamated and comes at a crucial point, fitting into the narrative unlike the YRF spy universe. This horror-comedy universe is expanding in the best way possible.

Do wait till the end as, after the Aayi Nai song, there's a post-credit scene and one more song, which has never been tried in Indian cinema. Surely, this is a theater experience that shouldn't be missed. It wouldn't be surprising if this film takes away all the business from other releases. Stree is calling you-listen to her. (Stree ko naa nahi bolte)

#pranureviews #Stree2 #Stree2Review.","Making a sequel to an already adored and loved movie is a Herculean task, but the makers took on this challenge and came out with flying colors.

Unlike other sequels where each part lacks connection, this one follows up on the first installment. This time, the women of Chanderi village are the prey of Sarkata's attacks, and their messiah Vicky, with the help of his lady love and Stree, of course, is hunting it. Who is Sarkata, how can they defeat it, and what's the relevance? These are the questions to watch out for.

This time, the story is spookier and fits well in the horror genre. There are ample jump scares, making it a must-watch for horror lovers. Meanwhile, the comic sequences have been handled expertly, and you can't stop laughing out loud. The makers have struck the right balance. Niren Bhatt's writing is the masterstroke here, as the dialogues are what ups the game for this movie.

But when i watched stree 2 it was very disappointing and just a waste of time.

I dont suggest it to watch, i dont know how people are rating 9 starts to this movie. May be bad taste of movies.

Anyway its their personal choice but i dont like this movie.

Some points i can share :




Personal suggestion is to watch Tarak Mehta rather than wasting time on Stree 2.","I was waiting for thus movie and even i thought that it will be a good movie like stree first part.

8.0,"The movie is comedy gold. Its meant to be lighthearted and fun and not to be taken too seriously. The unique blend of comedy with elements of horror is what sets this movie apart from the others.

Acting of the cast is superb and a delight to watch, except for Shraddha Kapoor's expressionless and lackluster performance.

The story is okay but could have been more sophisticated and meaningful and not a generic storyline.

As for the visual effects, they could have been better. You cannot expect Hollywood level of finesse, but they are still top-notch when compared with other feature films from the Indian subcontinent. Some visual effects shot does not make logical sense.

If you can ignore these minor hiccups, then this movie is definitely worth the watch in the cinemas for some lighthearted fun and laughter.","The movie is comedy gold.

They try to trap you with nostalgia and feel good factors from the first movie, rather than creating something original and exciting.

The unnecessary and boring music, forced laughter and clichéd jokes doesn't work most of the times in the movie.

Also someone from a big cinematic universe would be knocking on your doors to make you give credits for a particular scene and it's background music.

9.0,"""Stree 2"" successfully continues the blend of horror and comedy that made the original ""Stree"" a standout. This sequel builds on its predecessor with a mix of thrilling moments and humorous twists, making it a satisfying follow-up.

Rajkumar Rao reprises his role with the same charm and depth that made him a standout in the first film. His portrayal of Vicky is both endearing and entertaining, adding a layer of relatability to his character. His comedic timing is impeccable, and he navigates the blend of horror and humor with finesse, making his performance one of the film's highlights.

Shraddha Kapoor also returns, and her performance continues to captivate. Her role as Stree combines both the eerie and the charming, and Kapoor balances these elements effortlessly. The chemistry between Rao and Kapoor remains strong, adding depth to their on-screen partnership. Kapoor's ability to convey a range of emotions from fear to affection is crucial to the film's success.

The cameos in ""Stree 2"" are another highlight. These brief appearances add an extra layer of enjoyment to the film, offering surprises that enhance the overall experience. Each cameo is well-placed, providing both humor and additional context to the plot without overshadowing the main characters.

In terms of how to make a sequel, ""Stree 2"" gets it right. It respects the original's successful formula while introducing new elements to keep the story fresh. The film maintains the balance between comedy and horror, a key component of the original's appeal.

Pankaj Tripathi still managed to deliver a controlled acting but was ditchee by poor writing in most of hua scenes.

1.0,"This movie is a horror-comedy, which makes it worst of both worlds! The ""horror"" feels like it's trying to spook a toddler, while the comedy is so cringe-worthy, it's scary. It starts with some slapstick that barely lands, and then spirals into a plot so bad, even the script seems embarrassed. Remember those quirky characters you loved in the last one? Yeah, they're back... but now they're just lifeless, like someone deflated their personalities. Throwing in a few extra stars doesn't help-unless, of course, you enjoy watching talented actors wonder what they're doing with their lives.

The only real tension in this film is deciding whether to keep watching or switch to literally anything else-like watching paint dry, which has more dramatic depth. If you ever need to get back at someone, this movie should be your go-to punishment. And don't worry, I'm spoiler-free, unlike the movie itself. Honestly, watching it is the biggest spoiler of all!","This movie is a horror-comedy, which makes it worst of both worlds! The ""horror"" feels like it's trying to spook a toddler, while the comedy is so cringe-worthy, it's scary. It starts with some slapstick that barely lands, and then spirals into a plot so bad, even the script seems embarrassed. Remember those quirky characters you loved in the last one? Yeah, they're back... but now they're just lifeless, like someone deflated their personalities. Throwing in a few extra stars doesn't help-unless, of course, you enjoy watching talented actors wonder what they're doing with their lives.

The only real tension in this film is deciding whether to keep watching or switch to literally anything else-like watching paint dry, which has more dramatic depth. If you ever need to get back at someone, this movie should be your go-to punishment. And don't worry, I'm spoiler-free, unlike the movie itself. Honestly, watching it is the biggest spoiler of all!",0
10.0,"Stree 2, directed by Amar Kaushik, coasts along on the charms of the original. Yet it feels factory-made, unlike the first film, which felt tailor-made. Having rid his beloved Chanderi of the menace of Stree - a frightening female spirit who abducted lone men at night - ladies tailor Vicky is now a lovesick drunk.

Stree 2 is part of an ongoing cinematic universe. The film ends with a post-credit sequence and then a post-post-credit sequence. An actor who utterly jars with this world is shooed-in. This is a desparate new fad that has enchanted Indian cinema. It may pay dividends in the short term - as it has done for other franchises - but I suspect audiences here will soon tire of it. One feels particularly concerned for Maddock. Cops and spies and action heroes make sense for a team-up, as do superheroes, but werewolves and ghosts? When did they get so pally?

Almost The film entertain with some interesting story which has some thriller comedy story lines in it. Love It.","Stree 2, directed by Amar Kaushik, coasts along on the charms of the original.

8.0,"Stree 2 builds upon the success of its predecessor, offering a delightful blend of humor, horror, and heartwarming moments. The film picks up a few years after the events of the first part, finding the town of Chanderi still grappling with the mysterious disappearance of men during the festival of Stree.

Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor reprise their roles with commendable performances. Their chemistry on screen remains palpable, adding depth to the narrative.

The film is filled with clever dialogues and hilarious situations that keep the audience engaged and entertained. The comedic timing of the actors is impeccable.

While the horror elements are toned down compared to the first film, they are still executed well, creating a sense of suspense and tension. The supernatural elements are introduced gradually, building anticipation.

The film invests time in developing the characters, giving them more depth and making them relatable. The supporting cast also delivers solid performances.

Stree 2 subtly touches upon social issues like gender equality and the power dynamics within relationships, adding a layer of depth to the story.

The plot follows a familiar formula, and some of the twists and turns are easily guessed. While the film offers a satisfying conclusion, it lacks the element of surprise that the first film had.

The film could have benefited from a tighter screenplay, as the runtime feels a bit excessive at times. Some scenes could have been trimmed down without compromising the overall narrative.

The music score is energetic and complements the film's tone, adding to the suspense and humor.

The visual effects are generally well-done, although there are a few instances where they could have been improved.

The cinematography captures the eerie atmosphere of the town and the supernatural elements effectively, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

Stree 2 is a worthy sequel that manages to capture the magic of the original film. While it may not be as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it offers a satisfying blend of humor, horror, and heartwarming moments. Fans of the genre will likely find it a fun and entertaining watch.","Stree 2 builds upon the success of its predecessor, offering a delightful blend of humor, horror, and heartwarming moments.

Absolutely loved Shraddha as the unnamed woman, she's so damn pretty and so beautiful!!! She's the best actress of the year and she's given the highest grossing film of the year on her own shoulders! She looked ravishing and so hot in Khoobsoorat song!!!

Rajkummar Rao, Aparshakti Khurana, Abhishek Banerjee and Pankaj Tripathiji are so damn hilarious!! It was so funny hearing Rajkummar singing Calm Down and Aparshakti singing his own made up lullaby!

Loved Varun Dhawan's cameo as Bhediya and Akki's cameo as Sarkata's descendant!! Aag laga di!

Tamannaah's cameo as Shama in the song Aaj Ki Raat was sizzling hot!

Special mention to Sunil Kumar for his terrific portrayal as Sarkata!! Kamaal kar diya!!

Writing and direction are absolutely fantastic, music is really good, VFX is fantastic and BGM is great! I love all the songs from the movie!

1.0,"What can i say, i'm apalled. Indian cinema disappoints me, and just when i decide to give it another shot, i'm relentlessly let down, yet again. Utterly lacks creativity, repetitive ( and dry ) shallow humor from the first movie, poor scripts, an absolutely horrendous plot, too much overacting, and characters just drag you along. I liked the first movie better, but couldn't we have kept things naturally paranormal?

Painfully predictable as you find yourself anticipating what might seem obvious, and i guess i only hung through for shraddha kapoor, since she's gorgeous to watch. The dialogues and acting was a little over done, and very cringe worthy; as if to add copious amounts of humor, for whatever sake - and have it serve absolutely no purpose. Futile addition of further characters when there's alreaedy a chaotic picture drawn through. There's basically 0 development between any relavent timeline, between any character; or something that grows along with you. It does not connect; and it certainly doesnt proceed forward..

it's a decent watch if you're not really planning to get anywhere. It's just a bunch of scenes. No real depth; just flapping pages. Each. I pesonally think the VFX and graphics were pretty horrible for an otherwise raw movie.","What can i say, i'm apalled.

The film builds on the lore established in the first movie, diving deeper into the mysteries of the 'Stree.' The suspense is well-maintained, and the horror elements are more intense this time, with a few genuinely scary moments that will have you at the edge of your seat.

However, what truly sets ""Stree 2"" apart is its clever writing. The dialogues are sharp, witty, and filled with cultural references that add to the movie's unique flavor.

I don't mind if it's done well but why put these movies in multiverse doesn't even make any sense.

I don't know wtf is wrong with Indian audience no way movies like animal, stree 2, Pathan and other deserves this much attention and box office collection because of the audience they keep releasing these mid movies and people are happy and celebrating the quality is going down from past decade there are only few movies which were good in past decade instead of making thousands of movies a year Bollywood or Indian cinema needs to work on the quality.

The movie started good but went down the drain till the end. The cgi is so bad idk why do this much scene when you can't do it properly just skip them or do it practically. The ending was such a mess felt like watching a low budget tv show.","I love the first movie it was well written and paced movie with good humor but this one is just mess all over the place in my opinion this is just a cash grab and now they are forcing the multiverse which doesn't belong in this universe.

The story skillfully mixes horror and humor, offering an experience that's both entertaining and engaging. The screenplay is packed with witty one-liners, engaging drama, strong character dynamics, and plenty of spooky moments. The first half is a laugh riot, with audiences erupting in laughter, something rare to witness these days. The tone shifts in the second half, building up to a thrilling climax. The sequel ties up loose ends from the first film, expanding the universe in a promising way. Surprise cameos and references to the original film add an extra layer of enjoyment.

Rajkummar Rao once again shines with his impeccable comic timing, expressive acting, and perfect body language. Shraddha Kapoor looks stunning and delivers a solid performance, though her screen time could have been more. Aparshakti Khurana brings in some memorable moments, but the scene-stealers are Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Banerjee, who are hilarious in every scene they appear in.

The cinematography maintains the essence of the franchise, while the background score effectively enhances key scenes. The visuals are good but leave room for improvement. The dialogue is sharp and funny, though the music doesn't quite live up to the first part, coming across as merely decent. Some flaws include a shortage of jokes in the second half and the limited screen presence of Shraddha Kapoor. Despite these minor issues, I found ""Stree 2"" to be an even more enjoyable watch than the original.

Make sure to stay through the credits, as there are two mid-credit scenes (one before and one after the ""Aayi Nai"" song) that will leave you excited for ""Stree 3"". This film is a must-watch!","""Stree 2"" delivers everything fans of the first film hoped for, and even more. This sequel not only continues the laughter but also adds depth and clarity to the story, making it a must-watch.

10.0,"""Stree 2,""the much-anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-comedy ""Stree,"" delivers a thrilling blend of humor, horror, and social commentary that fans of the original have been eagerly awaiting. Directed by Amar Kaushik and produced by Dinesh Vijan and Raj Nidimoru, ""Stree 2"" not only lives up to its predecessor but in many ways surpasses it, cementing the franchise as one of the most innovative and entertaining in recent Indian cinema.

From the outset, ""Stree 2""sets the tone for a cinematic experience that is both hilarious and spine-chilling. The film continues the story of the small town of Chanderi, where the legend of the vengeful spirit, Stree, who abducts men during the annual festival, still looms large. However, this time, the stakes are higher, the scares are more intense, and the laughs are even louder.

The film begins with the town recovering from the events of the first movie, where Vicky (played by Rajkummar Rao) and his friends managed to temporarily fend off the ghostly Stree. But as the townsfolk prepare for another festival, strange occurrences start happening again, signaling the return of Stree. This time, however, the mystery deepens as it becomes clear that Stree is not the only supernatural force at play.

One of the standout aspects of ""Stree 2"" is its ability to balance horror with humor. Amar Kaushik has mastered the art of blending these two seemingly opposing genres, creating a film that can make you laugh out loud one moment and jump out of your seat the next. The screenplay, written by Raj Nidimoru, Krishna D. K., and Sumit Arora, is sharp, witty, and packed with memorable dialogues that will have audiences quoting them long after the credits roll.

Rajkummar Rao once again proves why he is one of the most versatile actors in Bollywood today. His portrayal of Vicky is both endearing and hilarious, making him the perfect protagonist for a film like ""Stree 2.""Rao's comic timing is impeccable, and he brings a sense of authenticity to the role that makes his character's journey all the more engaging. Whether he's trying to outwit a ghost or navigate the complexities of love, Rao's performance is a masterclass in how to anchor a film with charm and charisma.

Shraddha Kapoor, who reprises her role as the mysterious woman with a connection to Stree, brings a new depth to her character in the sequel. Her chemistry with Rajkummar Rao is electric, and their interactions provide some of the film's most memorable moments. Kapoor's performance is nuanced, adding layers to her character that make her even more intriguing than in the first film. As the story unfolds, her character's motivations and backstory are explored in greater detail, providing answers to some of the questions left unanswered in the original.

The supporting cast, including Pankaj Tripathi, Aparshakti Khurana, and Abhishek Banerjee, is equally strong, with each actor bringing their unique brand of humor to the film. Tripathi, in particular, shines as the eccentric Rudra Bhaiya, whose knowledge of the supernatural continues to provide both comic relief and crucial plot points. His deadpan delivery and quirky mannerisms make him a standout character in a film full of memorable performances.

Stree 2 also benefits from its strong technical aspects. The cinematography by Amar Kaushik is visually striking, capturing the eerie beauty of Chanderi and its haunted streets. The film's use of lighting and sound design is particularly effective in creating a tense and unsettling atmosphere. The score, composed by Sachin-Jigar, is a perfect blend of haunting melodies and catchy tunes that enhance the film's overall impact.

One of the most impressive elements of Stree 2 is its ability to weave social commentary into its narrative without ever feeling preachy. Just as the first film addressed the issue of gender dynamics and the fear women experience, Stree 2 delves deeper into these themes, exploring the consequences of societal norms and expectations. The film cleverly uses the supernatural elements as a metaphor for real-world issues, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.

In conclusion, Stree 2 is a worthy successor to the original, offering a perfect mix of horror, comedy, and social commentary. With stellar performances, sharp writing, and a gripping storyline, it stands as a testament to the creativity and innovation of Indian cinema. Whether you're a fan of the first film or a newcomer to the franchise, Stree 2is a must-watch that will leave you both laughing and looking over your shoulder long after the movie ends.","""Stree 2,""the much-anticipated sequel to the 2018 horror-comedy ""Stree,"" delivers a thrilling blend of humor, horror, and social commentary that fans of the original have been eagerly awaiting.

4.0,"Despite the widespread praise for Stree 2, I found it to be a clumsy and uninspired attempt at comedy. From the outset, it was clear that this movie was going to rely heavily on slapstick and exaggerated physical humor, which can be funny if done well. Unfortunately, the execution here felt more like a series of awkward moments strung together without any real sense of timing or cleverness. The humor seemed forced, and rather than coming across as naturally funny, it felt like the film was desperately trying to get a laugh but failing miserably.

One of the major issues was the characters. In many successful comedies, the humor stems from well-developed characters with distinct personalities and quirks that drive the narrative and jokes. In this case, the characters were one-dimensional, existing solely as vehicles for jokes that never landed. Their actions were predictable, and there was little to no depth to them. This lack of character development made it difficult to care about the story or find any of their interactions amusing. Every time they tried to be funny, it felt like a predictable setup with no real payoff.

The plot, if it could even be called that, was paper-thin. It seemed as if the writers were more focused on squeezing in as many gags as possible, rather than crafting a cohesive or engaging narrative. This approach made the movie feel disjointed, and many scenes seemed random or unnecessary. There was no clear flow to the story, and as a result, it was hard to stay invested in what was happening. Even if you put the lackluster plot aside, the pacing of the humor was off. Comedy often depends on sharp timing and well-executed jokes, but here, everything seemed to drag on or be mistimed, killing any potential for laughter.

Another aspect that contributed to my disappointment was the over-reliance on clichés and tropes. It felt as if the filmmakers were trying to rehash old comedic formulas that we've seen time and time again, without adding anything new or interesting to the mix. Instead of delivering fresh, clever humor, they leaned on tired jokes that have been done far better in other movies. This made the whole experience feel stale and predictable, like watching a poor imitation of far more successful comedies.

The physical comedy, which is often a key part of films like this, was also poorly executed. While slapstick can be hilarious when done right, here it felt more like watching a series of clumsy mishaps with no real humor behind them. There was no finesse to the physical gags; it just came off as people falling over or getting into awkward situations for no reason other than to fill time. Instead of laughing, I found myself cringing at how poorly these moments were pulled off.

It's also worth noting that comedy is, of course, subjective. What one person finds hilarious, another may find tedious or boring. And clearly, many people enjoyed this movie, as evidenced by its popularity and the positive reviews it has received. But for me, it was simply not funny. The humor missed the mark entirely, and I couldn't understand what others saw in it. The film left me wondering if I had missed something or if the jokes just weren't to my taste.

Ultimately, Stree 2 felt like a wasted opportunity. With better writing, stronger characters, and more attention to comedic timing, it could have been an enjoyable, light-hearted film. Instead, it was a disjointed mess that struggled to find its footing and never delivered the laughs it promised. For a movie that was supposed to be a comedy, it failed to bring any real humor, and I walked away feeling more disappointed than entertained.!","Despite the widespread praise for Stree 2, I found it to be a clumsy and uninspired attempt at comedy.

5.0,"Most anticipated sequel of Stree comes with mixed efforts summing up for a massive one time watch comedy therapy. Speaking about the frames, cinematography was supporting the emotions of the scenes pretty pleasantly. Selection of the shots and shot division was good enough for creating terror inside audiences hearts. Direction was quite mixed up. In the first half comedy sequences were hilarious and there was both situational and dialogue oriented comedy which brings authenticity. Kuddos to direction over there. In the second half director was trying hard to create some base for the future films based on Stree franchise which killed the expression of the scenes. Bgm was everywhere too much supporting and even sometimes loud than the dialogues. There were bunch of unwanted scenes in the second half. The Dance track of Tammana was totally not needed and if needed they could have done a better work. Speaking about the performances, Pankaj Tripati, Shraddha Kapoor, Aparshakti has done wonderful job and Rajkumar Rao and Abhishek Banerjee were the best. These actors pulled off the scenes so beautifully that audiences have thoroughly enjoyed the frames.

Stree's saree covering her face gave that extra fear factor and her movement levitating in the air , simple but so calm that the anticipation of horror would dry the throat. The Sar kata is just a monster revealed too soon. Last fight scene is long and dragged.

Overall didn't glue me to my seat like the first Stree. Must consider more suspense and build up for a horror character. Reveal the face after the 1st half.

Also Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan's role was totally unnecessary. It was super cringy to say the least.

Rajkumar Rao was amazing as always. Hope he is not overshadowed in the next part.

Not acting but just reading the lines. Whatever possessed these two actors to take such roles ? Shraddha Kapoor did not have much to do either.

I would not say there was any horror in this film. Just bad special effects and cartoonish characters. The headless bit got really silly and the end was monstrously terrible.

Even after the movie ended, there were two songs and more nonsense from Varun Dhawan as bhediya .

The only two things I liked in this film were two songs...Aaj ki raat by Madhubanti Bagchi and portrayed by Tamanaah Bhatia, and the final song Aayi nayi

Nothing else to recommend in this film. Sadly so . I had expected a more serious better made film.","I had big expectations from this movie after seeing the trailer but the actual movie was a huge let down.

While the first part focused on a very good and novel story with the right doses of comedy and horror intermixed,the 2nd part focused more on special effects,unnecessary screaming,shouting and overreacting and much much much less on the script,which resulted in this film falling absolutely flat! As usual the songs were completely unnecessary. In short this movie was an absolute,complete and total DISASTER with nothing at all being praiseworthy! At 2 hrs 27 mins the movie was a least 27 minutes too long

Rajkumar as well as Pankaj lacked the energy in comparison to the first part of the movie. Aparshakti has delivered for what he was cast in the movie. Abhishek felt a little too much at times.

After the interval, the movie slowed down and seemed to be strected unnecessarily.

The ending was abrupt and did injustice to the audience, which had been sitting for 2 hours. The run time of the movie could have been longer by 5-10 minutes and would have justified the climax.","Characters have done a good job with their roles, or at least have tried to.

But just when you think you know where the story is headed, Bhediya's character enters the scene, bringing with him a whole new set of challenges and mysteries.

8.0,"Today I went to the theater to watch Stree 2. What a movie! I really didn't expect any Indian sequel to deliver this kind of madness. It is better than the previous one. First of all, everyone in the theater chuckled, and the theater was fully packed after a long time for a commercial Hindi movie. Let's start this review by discussing the good and the bad parts of the movie.

Bad: I didn't find any bad aspects because I was so engrossed in the movie. I was particularly focused on Shraddha and Tamannaah, and the comic elements 😅. Jokes aside, people who haven't watched the previous parts-Stree 1, Bhediya, and Munjha-might feel confused in some parts. This could make it difficult for them to understand certain scenes and jokes. Also, not all the comical humor works; you can't laugh at every joke in a comedy movie, despite it being Hera Pheri 🙃.

Good: Now, talking about the good aspects, there are a lot of things I can count on. The screenwriting, play, and visuals are impressive. Yes, there are some scenes with poor CGI and VFX, but if you're not focused on them, you'll miss it. The actors' performances are really bombastic. You can't say this is just Shraddha's, Rajkumar's, Pankaj's, Abhishek's, or Aparshakti's movie-everyone gave their best. Even Tamannaah added significance to this movie, not just an ordinary cameo. The best part of this movie is that it never loses its magic. It's great to see that this sequel even overshadows the original one. At the end, it teases the next installment and connects the whole universe very well, building anticipation.

That's all from my end. I recommend going with your friends and family to watch this and enjoy it. It's a full theater experience movie.

I would give this movie an 8/10.","Today I went to the theater to watch Stree 2. What a movie! I really didn't expect any Indian sequel to deliver this kind of madness.

9.0,"Movie Review: Stree 2 screening in cinema halls near you !!

Another addition to the Maddock Supernatural universe!! Stree 2 lives up to the hype and comes like a breath of fresh air in an era where even good films r struggling to get a good opening!!

The story .. After Stree has been appeased in the first part, another threat looms large on Chanderi. A headless ghost , Sarkata is wreaking havoc on the women this time. The tables have turned and it is the women who live in fear this time around. Will our heroes Rajkumar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, Abhishek Bannerjee, Aparshakti Khurana & Pankaj Tripathi rise up to the occasion once again and free Chanderi from "" Sarkate ka Aatank""!!

Enjoyed it immensely, both scary & funny at the same time like it's predecessor. Fine balance between horror & comedy has been maintained perfectly all throughout which makes it a great watch for all age groups. VFX is decent and the new whistling tune signalling the entry of Sarkata is eerie .

In the acting department Rajkumar is fantastic & his antics will keep u entertained all throughout. His chemistry , especially the banter with his gang of boys Aparshakti and Bannerji is brilliant. Pankaj Tripathi is hilarious once again with his brand of straight faced comedy .. awesome indeed ! Shraddha Kapoor is charming yet has a dark aura which will give u goose pimples at times.

Who is the Sarkata ? Why is he targeting Chanderi? What is his connection to Stree? Who is Shraddha Kapoor & what is her connection to Chanderi ?

All questions will be answered in the movie !!

Cameos from Varun Dhawan & Akshay Kumar set the tone for more movies expected to come out of this supernatural universe!!

Tamanna Bhatia's item no is nice .. so is the song "" tune khayi jo kasam"" .

I enjoyed it .. grt entertainment Paisa vasool film . Would recommend that u watch it in theatres rather than on OTT .

P. S: DONT LEAVE TILL THE THEBEND CREDITS ROLL!!

Going with 3.5/5 for this one .. adios 🙂!!

But still why Varun Dhawan?? To mush messed up the scene if Rajkumar rao only the lead hero then he only should fight with devil and end like the stree 1st.

And please don't messed with stree 3 by adding Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan if it is gonna come in future. I will surely won't see the movie.","The first half was the best but why Varun Dhawan?

The film kept the humor that made the first Stree so popular, but also added more suspense, which made it really exciting to watch. The characters are just as lovable, and the plot kept me guessing with its twists and turns. It's a great mix of horror and comedy, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good, fun scare.

8.0,"Movie Review : ""Stree 2 - Sarkate Ka Aatank""

Viewer advisory : ""CBFC certification - UA"".

Some sequences may horrify children below the age of 8, hence in my humble opinion it's better not to take kids of that age group to the cinemas.

Those of you who have not seen its 2018 prequel (""Stree""), should see it to maintain continuity and get a better hold of the proceedings.

Synopsis : Just when Chanderi town seems to have returned to normalcy after the exit of ""Stree"", a new terror grips the town - a headless evil entity called 'Sarkata'. Now it's again up to Vicky & his 'gang' {including the nameless Shraddha Kapoor} to save Chanderi from the clutches of the headless monster.

Review : 6 yrs ago when ""Stree"" hit the screens, it was appreciated for its extremely unusual combo of horror & comedy done right. As a genre, Horror-Comedy needs a trickily effective balance of both elements. With ""Stree 2"", I am pleased to report that Director Amar Kaushik & his team have again succeesed in presenting a film that cleverly toes the line of the original and comes up trumps. Just like in ""Stree"", the horror sequences involving the demon as well as the comic camaraderie of Vicky & his friends is super effective here. Technically, the film employs a generous dose of VFX but it's very well done. Cinematography is also strong with the night sequences conveying a sense of dread throughout. Music is pretty good - There are 2 songs during the main film and 2 songs in the end credits. Acting wise, Rajkumar Rao once again leads from the front with a ""super-natural"" performance. Shraddha Kapoor has lesser screen time but she looks easy on the eye and does her part well. Rest of the supporting cast including Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Banerjee & Aparshakti Khurrana are all in good form. Tamannah Bhatia stars in an item song and a couple of scenes. There are a couple of surprise cameos, but I don't wanna share any spoilers here. The biggest plus point of ""Stree 2"" is that it comes across as a very well connected sequel to the original. The cast, sets, story & atmosphere are all in sync and the continuity feels very natural.

Verdict : If you enjoyed ""Stree"", I would definitely recommend the sequel. If you haven't seen the original, give that a try before watching this.

10.0,"Having eagerly awaited the release of 'Stree 2', I must say it exceeded all my expectations. The film brilliantly picks up from where it left off, delving deeper into the myths and legends that haunt the small town. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the haunting beauty of the locales while juxtaposing it with moments of sheer terror. The ensemble cast, with their impeccable comedic timing, ensures that the laughs are just as frequent as the scares. The script is tight, weaving in social commentary without being preachy. It's rare for a sequel to match the original's charm, but 'Stree 2' not only matches but elevates the franchise to new heights.","Having eagerly awaited the release of 'Stree 2', I must say it exceeded all my expectations.

9.0,"It's a challenge to balance the two extremes - comedy and horror - but director Amar Kaushik ensures that Stree2 never misses a beat. Horror comedy is a challenging genre, but the makers of 'Stree 2' have nailed it once again. This sequel retains all the charm of the first film, from the quirky small-town atmosphere to the eccentric characters and the simplicity of its people, blending these elements seamlessly for a winning formula. Sequels are often tricky, but the clever script flips the original plot-while Stree kidnapped men in the first film, this time a male villain, Sarkata, terrorizes and abducts women. With the characters already established, the story dives straight into action, delivering a fast-paced, tight screenplay that keeps viewers hooked, bolstered by a strong ensemble cast in top form. On the whole, Stree 2 is easily one of the most entertaining films of 2024 and a perfect Independence Day watch for cine lovers. Maddock Films and Jio Studios have definitely delivered a blockbuster of the year.

All characters were looking same, the set used was very like the previous one which didn't allow me to feel like it's a different movie or new version of movie.

Well, I think the las song should picturize on Raj Kumar Rao and Sharadha. There was no need to include Varun dhawan. Feeling bad for Raj Kumar.😳

It seems like the movie was to be continue.

Yeah I highly recommend to watch it.

With the characters already established, the story dives straight into action, delivering a fast-paced, tight screenplay that keeps viewers hooked, bolstered by a strong ensemble cast in top form.

The plot of 'Stree 2' picks up after the events of the first film, focusing on a new terror in Chanderi-Sarkata, a headless entity targeting and kidnapping women who have embraced modernity. The story takes a personal turn when Bittu's (Aparshakti Khurana) girlfriend, Chitti, falls victim to Sarkata's attacks. A letter received by Rudra Bhaiya (Pankaj Tripathi) contains the missing pages of the Chanderi Puraan, which played a key role in the first film. Using these clues, Bicky (Rajkummar Rao), Bittu, and Jana (Abhishek Banerjee) embark on a mission to track down Sarkata and end his reign of terror, with help from Shraddha Kapoor's character, who remains nameless in this installment as well.

Rajkumar Rao is once again in top form, delivering his signature performance with strong support from Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banerjee. Pankaj Tripathi continues to shine as Rudra, stealing scenes with his witty one-liners and impeccable shuddh Hindi. The screenplay gives each character their moment in the spotlight, allowing them all to stand out. However, Shraddha Kapoor's character feels underwhelming, as she appears sporadically and, apart from adding some intrigue, doesn't contribute much. One standout moment is when Sarkata chases Jana, who is riding with Pankaj Tripathi's character; Jana even manages to make the headless entity drink alcohol, offering a brief glimpse of a smiling Sarkata. Another highlight is Rajkumar Rao's hilarious rendition of Rema's 'Calm Down.' The film is filled with laughs and hits all the right notes for a horror comedy.

However, in the second half, the screenplay starts to feel sloppy, as if the makers were in a rush and running out of ideas. This becomes evident with the sudden special appearances by Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan. While Akshay's character does steer the plot in a new direction, it's clear his role was added to draw in more viewers-or perhaps hint at the creation of a shared 'Stree-Bhediya' universe. The pacing feels rushed, and one wishes the writers had given more attention to this part of the film. Despite this, 'Stree 2' delivers plenty of entertainment, and Amar Kaushik once again excels in direction. The film retains the energy and charm of the original, with a clever script that brings a fresh twist.","Horror comedy is a challenging genre, but the makers of 'Stree 2' have nailed it once again.

Rajkumar Rao performs well in horror, comedy and love scenes. You can feel for his unrequited and unconsummated love for Shraddha Kapoor's character. Shraddha Kapoor does well with whatever little role she gets. I anticipate a part 3 or later part which will expand on her background story, she remains a mystery in this part also. Only part that is revealed, is her connection to Stree. The side characters are awesome and add to the fun. The main guy who anchors and carries the film is Pankaj Tripathi with his brilliant one-liners.

9.0,"Ever since the trailer of ""Stree 2"" came, fans have been eagerly waiting for the film and with every song that was released, it created more hype and after watching the film, I can certainly say that the hype was worth it and it's real!

Stree 2 is pure joy and perfectly defines the genre of ""Horror-Comedy"" where both the flavours are effectively served and it does not get sour at all!

The film starts really well and there's not one single dull moment at all, there's tons of horror and tons of comedy in the first half till the interval! Post-interval, I felt the second half was not as good as first half but the events which unfold in the second half is something which absolutely was worth it!

After a really long time, here comes a movie where I've enjoyed myself after a hiatus and in terms of which film is better, I can say this film has delivered all the expectations and is certainly better than the first one in many aspects!

What makes me more happy is the fact that the first film, which was small on budget and gained success due to its great story and content, the sequel never felt like it's just for the sake of continuing the franchise and with other movies being a part of this ""Maddock Universe"" or ""Horror Universe"" which includes ""Stree, Bhediya, Munjya"" and now ""Stree 2"", this is a franchise which has become big for a reason, and that is pure content which is really missing these days! All these films are well interconnected and you would enjoy ""Stree 2"" more if you're aware of the previous films in this universe and even if not, you'll surely enjoy a lot!

This is a film which is big in terms of story, effects, details and it really surprises me that with a limited budget, this film has really pushed the genre and has matched the levels of ""Marvel Universe"", although it's not fair to compare it with, but I felt like saying it as we can finally be proud of having our own ""Indian Horror Universe""!!

Now coming to acting, this film is carried by these following people: Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, Pankaj Tripathi, Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banerjee!! Hands down, this ensemble cast has hit the ball out of the park and their chemistry with each other as well as their individual performances are the highlights of the film!

Rajkummar Rao: He has proven time and again that he's here to stay, the most incredible and versatile actor which people can easily relate with! His craft is just amazing and it feels like there's nothing this guy cannot do!

Shraddha Kapoor: She is simply a treat to the eyes! Her presence and acting is commendable and there's no doubt she's the most beautiful actress of today's generation! Her chemistry with Rajkummar was honest and noble and she is literally an ace performer!

P. S: I don't think the song ""Khoobsurat"" would've looked better on any other actress apart from her as she is literally the epitome of beauty and I'm addicted to that song because of the beautiful lyrics and composition (sung by ""Vishal Mishra"") and she makes it even more worthwhile with her charming beauty!

Pankaj Tripathi: An actor who outperforms everyone when he's in a scene! With simple grace and simple charm, you can't deny that he's a natural in whatever he does, be it serious drama or genuine comedy! Really happy to see his growth as an actor and it's a wonderful delight to see him in such comic roles!

Aparshakti Khurana: Provides effective support and does well in all his portions and has a great comic timing as well!

Abhishek Banerjee: I was literally taken aback seeing him perform, I can certainly say that some of the highlights in ""Stree 2"" is all those scenes where Abhishek simply excels in comedy, leaving others behind! You simply can't help but find him endearing and funny at the same time! He is exceptional in his role and has an effective talent!

Music: I generally don't love the music in most of the films and I only get to know about the songs whenever I see the entire film for the first time. But with Stree 2, with the exception of ""Aaj Ki Raat"", all the other songs, ""Aayi Nai, Tumhare Hain and Khoobsurat (which is my favourite one), these songs added to the buzz and hype and seeing each of these songs in the film made me super happy as the fact that most of the songs aren't simply in the film and are just used for ""Promotions"" or the songs are simply played in the background!

And the positioning of the songs in the film has been well-timed as there are hidden surprises within those songs!

And last but not the least, there are cameos, which really contributed to the film being good and effective and making it bigger!

Overall, ""Stree 2"" is pure delight, one of the best films of this year, with a strong repeat value, a film that can be watched and will be loved by all the generations! If you would go alone, with friends or family, you're bound to have a great time! It's a perfect stressbuster!

Once again, well done and huge congratulations to the entire team of ""Stree 2"", you deserve all the success!","Ever since the trailer of ""Stree 2"" came, fans have been eagerly waiting for the film and with every song that was released, it created more hype and after watching the film, I can certainly say that the hype was worth it and it's real!

The opening scene with the eerie chudail hovering over Chanderi, combined with that intense background score, set the stage for a plot filled with suspense and surprises. I was drawn to the way the story explored the changes in the town through the cryptic daak, building an atmosphere of dread. Vicky's obsession with Stree, despite the clear danger, added a unique emotional element to the plot. The twist where modern girls start disappearing instead of men was a refreshing change, adding new layers of tension and excitement to the story. The plot is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.","From the moment Stree 2 started, I was hooked.
